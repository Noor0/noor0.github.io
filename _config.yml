user_description: I am a result-oriented, self-motivated React/React Native developer with experience of working with different startups and a few freelance projects. I have been learning and working with different Javascript tools and technologies for quite some time. I find server-side development very interesting and have been learning Docker, a little bit of Kubernetes and Microservice Architecture recently. I love building products and learning new technologies.
